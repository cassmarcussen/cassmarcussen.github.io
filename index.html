  <h1>Cassandra Marcussen</h1>
<p>I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in theoretical computer science at <a href="https://toc.seas.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a>, advised by <a href="https://madhu.seas.harvard.edu/">Madhu Sudan</a>. In 2022, I graduated from Columbia University, where I double-majored in Mathematics and Computer Science and was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~xichen/Welcome.html">Xi Chen</a>. My research is supported by an NDSEG Fellowship. 
<br><br>
    I am interested in theoretical computer science and probability theory. I like to think about problems related to sublinear algorithms, random graphs, average-case complexity, and error correction.

<h2>Axioms</h2>
I firmly believe <a href="https://fardila.com/">Federico Ardila</a>'s axioms:
<ul>
   <li> Axiom 1. Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.</li>

   <li> Axiom 2. Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.</li>

   <li> Axiom 3. Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.</li>

   <li> Axiom 4. Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Music</h2>
Outside of theoretical computer science and mathematics, one of my passions is music. I am a classical cellist, and I also play the piano and sing. I am currently learning the Bach Cello Suite No. 6 and Rachmaninoff's Sonata in G minor for Cello and Piano, Op. 19.
